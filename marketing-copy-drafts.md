## Section 1: Dynamic Fees

### Current Draft
```
Badge: Feature 01

Dynamic Fees
Fix Static Fee Tier Fragmentation

Traditional AMMs fragment liquidity across 0.01%, 0.05%, 0.3%, and 1% fee tiers.
LPs guess which tier will perform best. Often, they guess wrong.

Alphix eliminates the guesswork.

Our dynamic fee algorithm adapts to market conditions in real-time,
maintaining optimal volume-to-TVL ratios across all environments.
One pool. One fee tier. Maximum efficiency.

Feature Cards:
- Adaptive Pricing: Fees adjust based on volume/TVL ratio
- Steady Volume Exposure: Consistent LP returns in any market
- Capital Efficient: No liquidity split across static tiers
- Trustless: All data sourced on-chain
```

### Key Value Props for LPs
- Dynamic fee approach allows LPs to have steady volume-exposure that adapts to market environments
- Enforces an average volume/TVL ratio
- Eliminates guessing which static fee tier to choose

## Section 2: Unified Pools Concept

### Current Draft
```
Badge: The Big Picture

Unified Pools
Solve Hook Fragmentation

Hooks are the biggest AMM innovation since concentrated liquidity in 2021.
The problem? Every new feature creates a new pool, fragmenting liquidity.

Today, hook-enabled pools control less than $100M in TVL—
less than 2% of Uniswap's total liquidity.

Alphix changes this.

We build on Uniswap v4 with upgradeable hook architecture.
Start with dynamic fees. Add MEV protection. Stack rehypothecation.
All without fragmenting liquidity or migrating positions.

Unified Pools don't just add features.
They compound them.

### The Mental Model to Teach

**Fragmentation Scenario:**
- Builder A adds dynamic fees → Pool A (10M TVL)
- Builder B adds MEV protection → Pool B (8M TVL)
- Builder C adds auto-rebalancing → Pool C (5M TVL)
- **Result:** ETH/USDC liquidity split across 3 pools (23M total but fragmented)

**Alphix Scenario:**
- Alphix launches with dynamic fees → 10M TVL in ONE pool
- Adds MEV protection → SAME pool, now 18M TVL (network effects)
- Adds auto-rebalancing → SAME pool, now 25M TVL (compounding)
- **Result:** ETH/USDC liquidity UNIFIED and growing (25M > 23M)

### Key Stats
- Hook-enabled pools today: <$100M TVL
- That's less than 2% of Uniswap's total value locked
- "We're building infrastructure to unlock the other 98%"

## Section 3: Why Alphix

### Three Pillars

**Composable**
- Stack innovations without trade-offs
- Add features seamlessly
- Your liquidity gets stronger, not scattered

**Secure**
- Rigorous audit process for every upgrade
- We ship features when they're ready, not when they're rushed
- No shortcuts. No compromises.

**Efficient**
- Maximize capital efficiency for LPs
- Adaptive mechanisms that respond to real market conditions
- Better returns through intelligent design

### The Moat (For Future Reference)
- "Why can't Uniswap just copy your feature stack?"
- Answer: They can't upgrade live pools without fragmenting liquidity
- This could be surfaced as: "Traditional AMMs can't upgrade live pools without fragmenting liquidity. We can. That's not just a feature. It's a moat."

## Section 5: Partnerships / Custom Pools

### Current Draft
```
Badge: Custom Solutions

Need Custom Pools?

We build Unified Pools tailored to your protocol's needs.
Dynamic fees. Rehypothecation. Custom hook logic.

Get all the efficiency of Alphix, designed for your users.

[Contact Us Button] → Opens email to contact@alphix.fi
```

### Context
- Example partner: Spectra (protocol needing custom pools)
- Revenue stream opportunity
- "Alphix can build Unified Pools aligned to their logic"

---

## Positioning Notes

### Target Audience Priority
1. Liquidity Providers (primary)
2. Protocol Partners (custom pools)
3. VCs (need to understand the moat)
4. Traders (secondary, benefit from better execution)

### Key Differentiators
1. **vs. Traditional AMMs:** Upgradeable without migration
2. **vs. Other Hook Builders:** Unified instead of fragmented
3. **vs. Single-Feature Protocols:** Composable architecture
4. **vs. Fast Shippers:** Security-first approach (unlike Cork/Bunni exploits)

### Strategic Context
- **Short-term:** Building on Uniswap v4 (niche entry point)
- **Long-term:** Infrastructure-agnostic leading DEX
- **Launch focus:** LPs who want better returns + protocols who need customization

### Common Objections to Address
1. "Why can't Uniswap copy you?" → Can't upgrade live pools without fragmenting
2. "Upgradeable contracts are risky" → Rigorous audits, no shortcuts
3. "AMMs are oversaturated" → Hooks are first innovation since 2021, <2% adoption
4. "Why not just use Uniswap v4?" → We compound features, they fragment

## Rejected/Alternative Copy

### Hero Alternatives (Not Used)
- "We Build Better Markets. For Everyone." (too vague)
- "Better Markets for Liquidity Providers" (too narrow)
- "Better Markets. Better Returns." (generic)

### Tagline Alternatives
- "Where every new feature compounds instead of competes." (too wordy)
- "We don't make you choose between innovation and liquidity depth." (confusing)
- "Stack features. Unify liquidity. Compete with deeper markets." (corny per Carl)

---

## Brand Voice Guidelines

### Do:
- Be specific (numbers, examples, concrete benefits)
- Educate (users know fragmentation exists but not what it means)
- Show the evolution (Dynamic Fees → more features coming)
- Balance technical depth with accessibility

### Don't:
- Use "For Everyone" messaging (too broad)
- Mention competitors by name
- Over-promise on features not yet live
- Use corny taglines or weak positioning
- Focus too much on "supporting Uniswap" (we're building a DEX, not a Uniswap plugin)

---

## Visual/Design Notes

### Existing Assets to Leverage
- WebGL hero animation (keep)
- Mock swap component with 3D tilt effect (keep)
- Pulsating "Closed Beta" badge (works great per Carl)
- DisplayCards component (composable features visualization)
- Infrastructure Agnostic diagram
- Unified-Hook.png (pool architecture)

### New Visuals Needed
- Fragmentation vs. Unified comparison diagram (Section 2)
- Logo assets for social proof section (Base, IncuBase, ETHCC, Uniswap Foundation)
- Three-column layout for Why Alphix section
- Partnership/contact section design

---

## CTA Strategy

### Primary CTA
- "Open App" (not "Request Access")
- Goes to /swap
- Open beta (no signup required)

### Secondary CTAs
- "Read the Docs" (for technical deep-dive)
- "Contact Us" (for partnerships)

---

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Page Structure (Confirmed)
1. Hero - Unified Pools messaging
2. Section 1 - Dynamic Fees (fix static fee fragmentation)
3. Section 2 - Unified Pools concept (fix hook fragmentation + stats)
4. Section 3 - Why Alphix (Composable/Secure/Efficient)
5. Section 4 - Social Proof (logo list)
6. Section 5 - Partnerships/Contact
7. Footer

### Styling Approach
- Follow existing patterns from current page.tsx
- Use Inter font family, maintain weight hierarchy
- Consistent spacing with current sections
- Badge components with hover states
- Responsive grid layouts (1 col mobile, 2-3 col desktop)
- Maintain dark theme (#0f0f0f background)
- Use opacity for text hierarchy (white @ 65% for body copy)
