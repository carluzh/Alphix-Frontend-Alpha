9.4 Assumption of Risks
You acknowledge that interacting with blockchain technology, smart contracts, and digital assets involves significant risks, including but not limited to:
loss of private keys or wallet access;
smart contract vulnerabilities or exploits;
irreversible transactions;
regulatory or tax uncertainty;
price volatility and liquidity risk;

Certain aspects of the Protocol may be subject to control by multisignature wallets or governance mechanisms, including pausing, upgrades, or parameter adjustments. Such controls may be exercised by persons not under the control of the Alphix Association.
You accept that the Protocol may not be fully decentralised at all times and that risks may evolve over time.

12. Miscellaneous
If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect. Failure to enforce any right shall not constitute a waiver.
