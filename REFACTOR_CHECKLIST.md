## üîÑ Next Steps (For You)

### Before Deploying to Staging

#### 1. Code Review
- [ ] Review all new files for consistency
- [ ] Check TypeScript has no errors: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Check ESLint passes: `npm run lint`
- [ ] Verify all tests pass: `npm test`

#### 2. Test in Development
- [ ] Run `npm run dev`
- [ ] Switch to `AppKitProviderV2` in `app/layout.tsx`
- [ ] Test liquidity page loads correctly
- [ ] Test adding liquidity works
- [ ] Test removing liquidity works
- [ ] Test collecting fees works
- [ ] Check React Query DevTools (bottom-right)
- [ ] Check browser console for errors

#### 3. Performance Testing
- [ ] Measure page load time (before/after)
- [ ] Check network tab for duplicate requests
- [ ] Verify cache hits in DevTools
- [ ] Test with slow network (throttle to 3G)

---

### Deploying to Staging

#### 1. Pre-Deploy
- [ ] All tests pass in CI/CD
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] No ESLint warnings
- [ ] Code reviewed by team

#### 2. Deploy
- [ ] Deploy to staging environment
- [ ] Smoke test critical paths:
  - [ ] Connect wallet
  - [ ] Load liquidity page
  - [ ] Add liquidity
  - [ ] Remove liquidity
  - [ ] Collect fees
- [ ] Monitor error logs for 24 hours

#### 3. Post-Deploy
- [ ] Check Vercel analytics for errors
- [ ] Verify cache hit rates are reasonable
- [ ] Check page load performance
- [ ] Gather team feedback

---

### Gradual Production Rollout

#### Week 1: Low-Risk Pages
- [ ] Migrate swap page
  - [ ] Update imports
  - [ ] Test thoroughly
  - [ ] Deploy
  - [ ] Monitor for 3 days
- [ ] Migrate landing page (if applicable)

#### Week 2: Medium-Risk Pages
- [ ] Migrate liquidity overview page (`app/liquidity/page.tsx`)
  - [ ] Replace `fetchAllPoolStatsBatch` with `usePoolsBatch`
  - [ ] Replace `loadUserPositionIds` with `useUserPositionIds`
  - [ ] Replace manual position loading with `useUserPositions`
  - [ ] Test all user flows
  - [ ] Deploy
  - [ ] Monitor for 3 days

#### Week 3: High-Risk Pages
- [ ] Migrate pool detail pages (`app/liquidity/[poolId]/page.tsx`)
  - [ ] Replace pool state fetching
  - [ ] Update mutation hooks
  - [ ] Test add/remove/collect flows
  - [ ] Deploy
  - [ ] Monitor for 1 week

#### Week 4: Cleanup
- [ ] Verify all pages migrated
- [ ] Delete old cache files:
  - [ ] `lib/client-cache.ts`
  - [ ] `lib/cache-version.ts`
  - [ ] `lib/cache-keys.ts` (old version)
- [ ] Update all documentation
- [ ] Remove `AppKitProvider` (old version)
- [ ] Archive migration guides

---

### Team Training

#### Before Rollout
- [ ] Share migration guide with team
- [ ] Explain new architecture (30 min presentation)
- [ ] Demo React Query DevTools
- [ ] Show how to write new query hooks

#### During Rollout
- [ ] Pair programming for first migration
- [ ] Code review all migrations
- [ ] Document common patterns
- [ ] Share troubleshooting tips

#### After Rollout
- [ ] Retrospective: What worked well?
- [ ] Document lessons learned
- [ ] Update onboarding docs
- [ ] Create quick reference guide

## üö® Rollback Plan

If critical issues occur at any stage:

### Immediate Rollback (< 10 minutes)
1. [ ] Revert `app/layout.tsx` to use old `AppKitProvider`
2. [ ] Redeploy
3. [ ] Verify site works
4. [ ] Investigate issue offline

### Partial Rollback (Per Page)
1. [ ] Revert imports in affected page
2. [ ] Restore old fetch logic
3. [ ] Test locally
4. [ ] Redeploy
5. [ ] Investigate issue

### Full Rollback (If Necessary)
1. [ ] Revert all migrations
2. [ ] Delete new cache files
3. [ ] Restore old system
4. [ ] Post-mortem analysis

## üìù Notes

### Architecture Decisions
- **Why React Query?** Eliminates need for custom deduplication, provides better DX
- **Why keep localStorage?** Cross-session persistence improves UX
- **Why centralize invalidation?** Prevents bugs from missed cache layers

### Key Files to Review
1. `lib/cache/index.ts` - Public API
2. `lib/cache/client/query-client.ts` - React Query config
3. `lib/cache/coordination/invalidation-orchestrator.ts` - Invalidation logic
4. `lib/cache/client/mutations.ts` - Transaction mutations

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests cover individual components
- Integration tests cover complete user flows
- Manual testing covers edge cases

### Migration Priority
1. Low-risk pages first (swap, landing)
2. Medium-risk pages second (liquidity overview)
3. High-risk pages last (pool details)
4. Cleanup after all migrated
